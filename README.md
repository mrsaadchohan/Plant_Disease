# Plant Disease Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying diseases in plants through automated image analysis, which can lead to timely interventions and improved crop health.

## Key Features

Image Preprocessing: Images are resized to a fixed size (e.g., 256x256) and augmented using techniques like horizontal flipping, random rotation, and zoom to improve model robustness.
Model Architecture: A CNN model was built and trained to classify plant diseases. The architecture leverages convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract and classify features.
Dataset: A labeled dataset containing images of plants with various diseases and healthy plants was used.
